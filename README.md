3D Modeling application

This is a project that I made during my course fullstack developer.
My goal was to program a 3D application to learn solid object oriented programming skills and to see how many features I could add.
I used C#, xaml for the node window and the glfw dll for the 3D view.
For this project I wrote:
A parser to translate common .obj files to my own datastructure. 
A gui framework to store, use and display the nodes and connections that make up the 3D models.
A 3D render framework that uses the glfw library to make use of open gl hardware rendering.
A keyframe object to animate most of the parameters.
